# TicTacToe Tutorial

Made this TicTacToe following the [official React tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) to get a grasp at the basics of React, since I'm rusty and want to get a good foundation in React.

This is only the beggining of my journey as I want to get better and better at React.
